> A map of places I've checked in on Earth.

Why
---

- I want to plot all the places I've been to on a map.
- I want a digital version of push pins on a physical map.
- I want to show people where I've been to.
- I want to see where I haven't been to.
- I want to try [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/).
- I like the cool maps from [Gyroscope](https://gyrosco.pe/).
- I need an excuse to get a `.earth` TLD, inspired by [Conquer Earth](https://conquer.earth/). (I already have [`.life`](http://cheeaun.life/))

Development
---

### First steps

1. [Generate access token](https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/auth) from Foursquare (requires your own CLIENT ID, etc; figure it out on your own).
2. Create `.env` file, with environment-specific variables on new lines:

```
ACCESS_TOKEN=XXX
```

### Wonderful `yarn` scripts

- `yarn checkins` - Fetch all checks-ins from Foursquare. Raw `checkins.json` is not part of repo because of privacy. `checkins[.min].geojson` files have *shortened* coordinates for privacy.
- `yarn countries`
  - Remember to [install SVGO first](https://github.com/svg/svgo) (globally) before running this.
  - Download a copy of country maps from [Sn3b/mapsicon](https://github.com/Sn3b/mapsicon) (Uses [napa](https://github.com/shama/napa) because it doesn't have a `package.json`). Then generate all optimized SVG countries.
- `yarn start` - Watch and transpile `assets/app.raw.js`, and start the server.

Future
---

- Make this available for other people. Self-hosted or hosted?
- Date & time range filtering, for check-ins.
